##🎊🎊🎊 Welcome to My Personal Page🎊🎊🎊

Hi my name is Serhat and I study Civil Engineering at Gazi University. I make different home plans from different cultures. I want to mix two or three culturel home design or autocad plans.

Before I do that I know I do not have enough knowledge and experience about cultures and designs but I have a passion for that and I am ambitious so I set up this site because I want to transfer the experiences I will gain here.
